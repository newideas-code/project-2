## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```
3. **Install Node.js:**  Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Usage Guide

This project is a simple script; no external dependencies need to be installed. To run the program:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `project-2` directory.
2. Execute the `index.js` file using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
The output will be `6`, the sum of the two variables `a` and `b`.

The `demo.js` file is a simple example file and can be run similarly using `node demo.js`.


## Code Snippets

**index.js:** This file contains the core logic for adding two numbers.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans);
```

This snippet declares two constants, `a` and `b`, assigns them values, calculates their sum, and prints the result to the console.

**demo.js:** This file demonstrates a simple console output.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```
