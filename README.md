## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```
3. **Ensure Node.js is installed:**  This project requires Node.js to run.  Download and install it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already.


## Usage Guide

This project performs a simple addition operation. To run the code:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `project-2` directory.
2. Run the `index.js` file using the command:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   The output will be `6`, the sum of 2 and 4.

3. To run the `demo.js` file, use the command:
   ```bash
   node demo.js
   ```
   This will print "This is demo file" to the console.


## Code Snippets

**index.js:** This file contains the core logic for the addition operation.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans);
```

**demo.js:** This file serves as a simple demonstration.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```


## Features
