## Usage Guide

This project consists of two JavaScript files: `index.js` and `demo.js`.  To run the code, you can use Node.js:

1.  **Run `index.js`:**
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    This will output "6" to your console, representing the sum of 2 and 4.

2. **Run `demo.js`:**
    ```bash
    node demo.js
    ```
    This will output "This is demo file" to your console.


## Code Snippets

**index.js:** This file performs a simple addition.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans);
```

**demo.js:** This file demonstrates a simple console output.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```
