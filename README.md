## Usage Guide

This project doesn't require any user input. The calculation is hardcoded. To run the project:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the `index.js` file using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   This will output the sum of the two predefined variables (`a` and `b`) to the console.  The `demo.js` file can be run similarly:
   ```bash
   node demo.js
   ```


## Code Snippets

**index.js:** This file performs the addition of two predefined variables.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans); // Outputs 6 to the console
```

**demo.js:** This file demonstrates a simple console output.

```javascript
console.log("This is a demo file.");
```
