This project doesn't require any user input.  To run the project:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command:

   node index.js
   ```

This will execute the `index.js` file and print the sum of the two variables to the console.


## Code Snippets

**index.js:** This file contains the core logic of the addition.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans);
```

This snippet declares two constants, `a` and `b`, assigns them values, calculates their sum and prints the result (`6`) to the console.


**demo.js:**  This is a simple demonstration file.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```

This snippet simply prints a message to the console.
