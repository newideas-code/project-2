â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ demo.js
â””â”€â”€ index.js
```

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```
3. **No other dependencies are required.** This project uses only built-in JavaScript functionality.


## Usage Guide

This project doesn't require any specific setup or input beyond running the JavaScript files. To execute the code:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `node index.js` to execute the main calculation script.  The result (6) will be printed to the console.
3. Run `node demo.js` to execute the demo script, which will print "This is demo file" to the console.


## Code Snippets

**`index.js`:** This file performs the core arithmetic operation.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans); // Outputs: 6
```

**`demo.js`:** This file demonstrates a simple console output.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```


## Features

* Performs a simple addition of two numbers.
* Demonstrates basic JavaScript file structure and execution.
* Includes a secondary file for demonstrating simple console output.
