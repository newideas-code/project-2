## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```
3. **Ensure Node.js is installed:** This project requires Node.js to run the JavaScript files.  You can download and install it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).


## Usage Guide

This project contains two JavaScript files: `index.js` and `demo.js`.

* **`index.js`**: Performs a simple addition operation and prints the result to the console.
* **`demo.js`**: Prints a simple message to the console.

To run the files, use the Node.js command-line interface:

1. **Run `index.js`:**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   This will output `6` to your console.

2. **Run `demo.js`:**
   ```bash
   node demo.js
   ```
   This will output `This is demo file ` to your console.


## Code Snippets

**index.js:**

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans); // Output: 6
```
This code declares two variables, `a` and `b`, assigns them values, calculates their sum, and then prints the result using `console.log`.

**demo.js:**

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file "); // Output: This is demo file
```
This code simply prints a message to the console using `console.log`.


## Features

- Performs basic addition of two numbers.
- Demonstrates basic console output in JavaScript.
- Contains two separate example files showcasing different aspects of basic JavaScript functionality.
