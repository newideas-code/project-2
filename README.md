## Code Snippets

**index.js:** This file contains the core logic for the addition operation.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans);
```

This snippet declares two variables, `a` and `b`, assigns them values, calculates their sum and prints the result to the console.

**demo.js:** This is a simple demo file.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```

This snippet simply prints a message to the console.
