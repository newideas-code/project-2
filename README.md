```

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```
3. No further installation is needed as this is a simple JavaScript project.  You can run the code directly using Node.js.

## Usage Guide

This project performs a simple addition operation. To run the code:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the `project-2` directory.
3. Run the `index.js` file using the command:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
The output will be `6`, the sum of 2 and 4.

The `demo.js` file is a simple example and can be run similarly using `node demo.js`.

## Code Snippets

**index.js:** This file contains the core logic for the addition operation.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans);
```

**demo.js:** This file serves as a simple demonstration.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```
