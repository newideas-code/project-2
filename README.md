â”œâ”€â”€ demo.js
â””â”€â”€ index.js
```


## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```
3. **No further installation is required.** This project uses only built-in JavaScript functionality.


## Usage Guide

This project doesn't require any user input.  To run the code:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory (as shown in the Installation Instructions).
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
This will execute the `index.js` file and print the result of the addition operation (6) to the console.  The `demo.js` file can be run similarly using `node demo.js`.


## Code Snippets

**index.js:** This file contains the core logic of the calculator.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans);
```

This snippet declares two constants, `a` and `b`, assigns them values, adds them together, and then prints the result to the console.

**demo.js:** This file serves as a simple demonstration.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```

This snippet simply prints a message to the console.


## Features

* **Addition of two numbers:** The project performs a simple addition operation on two pre-defined numbers.
