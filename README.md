## Folder Structure

```
project-2/
â”œâ”€â”€ demo.js
â””â”€â”€ index.js
```


## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```
3. **No further installations are required.**  This project uses only built-in JavaScript functionality.


## Usage Guide

This project contains two JavaScript files: `demo.js` and `index.js`.  `demo.js` simply prints a message to the console.  `index.js` performs a simple addition operation.

To run the code:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Execute the following commands:

For `demo.js`:
```bash
node demo.js
```

For `index.js`:
```bash
node index.js
```

This will print the output to your console.


## Code Snippets

**`demo.js`:**

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```
This file demonstrates a simple console output in JavaScript.

**`index.js`:**

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans);
```
This file declares two variables, `a` and `b`, assigns them values, adds them together, and prints the result to the console.


## Features

* Simple addition of two numbers.
* Demonstrates basic JavaScript variable declaration and arithmetic operations.
