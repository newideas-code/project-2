## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```
3. **No further installation is required.** This project uses only basic JavaScript and doesn't have any external dependencies.


## Usage Guide

This project consists of two JavaScript files: `index.js` and `demo.js`.  `index.js` performs a simple addition operation, while `demo.js` displays a simple message. To run these files, you can use Node.js:

1. **Run `index.js`:**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   This will print the sum of `a` and `b` (which is 6) to the console.

2. **Run `demo.js`:**
   ```bash
   node demo.js
   ```
   This will print "This is demo file" to the console.


## Code Snippets

**index.js:** This file performs a simple addition.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans); // Output: 6
```

**demo.js:** This file demonstrates a simple console output.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file "); // Output: This is demo file
```


## Features

- Performs a basic addition operation.
