# Project 2: A Simple JavaScript Addition Program

This project is a basic JavaScript program demonstrating a simple addition operation. It serves as a foundational example for understanding basic JavaScript syntax and execution.  It includes two files: `index.js` which performs the addition, and `demo.js` which provides a simple console output example.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```

3. **Install Node.js (if not already installed):** This project requires Node.js to run. Download and install it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).  Ensure Node.js is added to your system's PATH environment variable.

4. **No further installation is needed.** This project is a simple JavaScript program and requires no external dependencies beyond Node.js.


## Usage Guide

This project contains two JavaScript files: `index.js` and `demo.js`.

1. **Run `index.js`:** Open your terminal, navigate to the `project-2` directory, and execute the `index.js` file using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   This will output the sum of the variables `a` and `b` (which is 6) to the console.

2. **Run `demo.js`:** Similarly, you can execute `demo.js`, which simply prints a message to the console:

   ```bash
   node demo.js
   ```


## Code Snippets

**`index.js`:** This file contains the core logic of the addition operation.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans);
```

This code snippet declares two constant variables, `a` and `b`, assigns them integer values, calculates their sum and stores it in the `ans` variable, and finally prints the result to the console using `console.log()`.

**`demo.js`:** A simple demonstration file showcasing basic console output.

```javascript
console.log("This is a demo file.");
```

This snippet demonstrates a basic use of `console.log()` to output a string to the console.


## Features

* Performs a simple addition of two integer variables.
* Demonstrates basic JavaScript syntax and console output.
* Includes a second file (`demo.js`) showcasing a simple console message.
