## Folder Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ demo.js
â””â”€â”€ index.js
```


## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**  Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```

3. **No further installation is needed.** This project is a simple JavaScript program and requires no external dependencies.  You can run the code directly using a JavaScript runtime environment (like Node.js).


## Usage Guide

1. **Run `index.js`:** Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Execute the `index.js` file using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   This will output the sum of the variables `a` and `b` (which is 6) to the console.

2. **Run `demo.js`:** Similarly, you can execute `demo.js` which simply prints a message to the console:

   ```bash
   node demo.js
   ```


## Code Snippets

**`index.js`:** This file contains the core logic of the addition operation.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans);
```

This code snippet declares two variables, `a` and `b`, assigns them integer values, calculates their sum and stores it in the `ans` variable, and finally prints the result to the console using `console.log()`.

**`demo.js`:** A simple demonstration file showing basic console output.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```


## Features

*   Performs a simple addition of two integer variables.
*   Demonstrates basic JavaScript syntax and console output.
