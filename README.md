## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```
3.  No further installation is required as this is a simple JavaScript project that can be run directly in a Node.js environment.


## Usage Guide

This project doesn't require any user input.  To run the project:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `index.js` file using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   This will output the sum of the two predefined variables (a and b) to the console.  The `demo.js` file can be run similarly.


## Code Snippets

**index.js:** This file performs the addition.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans); // Outputs 6 to the console
```

**demo.js:** This file demonstrates a simple console output.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```
