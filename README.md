```


## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newideas-code/project-2.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd project-2
   ```
3.  No further installation is needed as this is a simple JavaScript project that runs directly in Node.js.


## Usage Guide

This project uses Node.js to run the JavaScript code.  To execute the code:

1. **Ensure Node.js is installed:**  You can check by running `node -v` in your terminal. If it's not installed, download and install it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Run `index.js`:**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
This will output the sum of the two variables `a` and `b` (which are 2 and 4 respectively) to the console.  The output will be:

```
6
```

To run `demo.js`, execute:

```bash
node demo.js
```

This will output:

```
This is demo file 
```


## Code Snippets

**index.js:** This file contains the core logic of the calculator.

```javascript
const a = 2;
const b = 4;
const ans = a + b;
console.log(ans);
```
This code declares two constants, `a` and `b`, assigns them values, calculates their sum, and then prints the result to the console using `console.log()`.


**demo.js:** A simple demonstration file.

```javascript
console.log("This is demo file ");
```

This file simply prints a message to the console.


## Features

* Performs addition of two predefined numbers.
* Simple and easy to understand code.
